## Going Forward

This was my first project working with Electron which has been pretty neat. I really enjoyed working with just one stack for everything.

Some issues I really want to work on for the future:

* Technical Debt:
    * In this project I found myself having to rewrite some earlier code to fix/improve it since a new feature is being blocked because of it.

* Scope of Project:
    * Since I'm the lone person working on this I was handling everything from design to backend and I just planned too much when the application wasn't even a github repo
